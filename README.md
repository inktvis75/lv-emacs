# My Emacs Configuration

This repository contains my personal Emacs configuration, tailored to enhance productivity and streamline workflows. 
It includes custom settings, keybindings, and additional Emacs Lisp scripts to optimize the editing experience. 
The configuration is based on the work from [Hadi Timachi](https://codeberg.org/haditim/dotemacs).

Feel free to use and adapt it to suit your own needs!
